the police version is also that #MikeBrown approached the officer. But if he had JUST robbed a store, why approach police?? #Ferguson
.....for a cover-up to be successful....you must first discredit the victim.....

#Ferguson
7) #MikeBrown was approached for mouthing off to a cop (both  #Ferguson PD &amp; eyewitness testimonies reflect this). NOT as a robbery suspect
Swat team in #Ferguson have state mandated 'murder insurance' to protect them from lawsuits if they kill anyone.
If anyone's looking for a reason to murder me execution-style in the street, I stole a coke from a Walmart when I was 19. #Ferguson
Oh, whoops, the robbery had nothing to do with #MikeBrown being stopped, but at least now half of America thinks it did. - #Ferguson PD

So, to sum up: 1) Darren Wilson KNEW NOTHING of the robbery, 2) shot #MikeBrown over jaywalking, and 3) was allowed to escape #Ferguson.
Americans are 8 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than by a terrorist. #Ferguson

From jaywalking to strong-arm robbery. 

Mhm... #Ferguson
FACT. We know more about how #MikeBrown allegedly stole cheap cigars than how and why a #Ferguson police officer shot and killed him.

Even if #MikeBrown was running down the street with a bag full of boosted goods, he deserved a trial. Not a street execution. #Ferguson
REMINDER: #MikeBrown was a kid who just wanted to walk down a street. And for that, HE IS DEAD. Those are the facts. #Ferguson
It was a St. Louis County police officer who shot this man, according to PIO Brian Schellman. #ferguson
Being shot 10 times in the street for stealing cigars is due process? No arrest. No trial. No conviction―just immediate execution. #Ferguson
#Ferguson PD releases robbery incident report smearing #MikeBrown but not shooting incident report. Did they think we wouldn’t notice?
So since we now know the officer knew nothing abt a robbery, we must ask why those tapes were released? #Ferguson. But we know why.
So a large Negro robbed a store and then the cops saw a large Negro.

WHAT WERE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO?!?!

Perhaps not execute him. #Ferguson
17 year old unarmed kid shot ten times by police for stealing candy. I didn't know that was punishable by death.

So lets recap. No dashboard cam of the incident. But definitely photos of Michael Brown in a store. Funny how that happens #NMOS14 #Ferguson
Key point: Officer Wilson was not aware that #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect. It will be key in establishing his state of mind. #Ferguson
If there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not the video itself? #Ferguson
Michael Brown was suspected of robbing store in #Ferguson before being shot, say police http://t.co/KUZQGasFgA http://t.co/TjuEVB8z5m
The surveillance tape the police have on TV DOESNT even look like anything near Canfield Green apts. #MIKEBROWN #Ferguson
The info given today seems to line up with this witness account, even the alleged theft: http://t.co/7hjBIrf1a3

#Ferguson #MikeBrown
Question for #Ferguson police chief? If OFFICER DARREN WILSON was in pursuit of a robbery suspect, why tell kids to get out of the road? LIE
You'd think it would've been more newsworthy when Missouri got rid of due process and made shoplifting a capital crime #Ferguson #MikeBrown
now shameful #ferguson police say Brown wasn't even a robbery suspect when he was shot. he was just an unarmed kid walking down the street.
Why would the officer tell #MikeBrown to get out of the street if he was a suspect? #Ferguson
An observation from yrs in practice - if it takes you 5 days to get your story out &amp; it doesn't make sense, it's probably not true #Ferguson
#Ferguson Police Chief confirms when officer stopped #MikeBrown, he was not aware he was a suspect in a robbery.
UPDATE - Shooter #DarrenWilson didn't know #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect: #Ferguson http://t.co/p05krSfaXL http://t.co/R8CJVoTvex
A woman in #Ferguson was shot in head last night and released this selfie. Conflicting reports of how it happened: http://t.co/25WX6EkquG
In 2009 #Ferguson PD beat a black man, then charged him for getting blood on their uniforms http://t.co/Y1QTm1BZyt http://t.co/KcuZ5VFMOn
All weekend ppl will be talking about the "robbery" instead of the shooting bc #Ferguson PD didn't release any info about the shooting.
Update: #Ferguson police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery http://t.co/rl0RgIphUp http://t.co/PHUofG7mJR
#Ferguson police once charged a man with property damage because his blood got on their uniforms when they beat him.

Store owner told @FOX2now Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown; said it was someone else #Ferguson
If Mike Brown was engaged in a robbery before being shot, why isn't his alleged accomplice under arrest? #Ferguson http://t.co/upMLU4bbK4
Cigarettes on Staten Island. Cigars in #Ferguson. Are these seriously enough to take a life?
#Ferguson chief let most of day go by b4 disclosing (after repeated Qs) that cop who killed #MikeBrown knew nothing about robbery. DANGER
#ferguson has had ZERO homicides in the last year. 'Black on black crime is our real problem' folks where y'all at?
I'd be more inclined to take the #Ferguson PD account seriously if they hadn't been so careful to confiscate all video evidence beforehand.
New link: #Ferguson police release video they say shows a robbery involving #MichaelBrown: http://t.co/GMDuU33oed http://t.co/RaAWvjcWNu
The name of the officer who shot #MikeBrown has been named. His name is Darren Wilson, a 6-year veteran of the #Ferguson police department.
Report: #Ferguson police beat up wrong suspect then charged him for getting blood on uniforms in 2009 http://t.co/Mck8FYYOpp
You release the robbery report and not the shooting report? Do you think we don't see you?#Ferguson PD?

This isn't the first time #Ferguson PD lied. Read this article. http://t.co/3miqibGdzQ
to be clear: an unarmed teenager POSSIBLY stealing a box of cigars does not warrant being shot to death by the police. #Ferguson
#ThatAwkwardMoment when the #Ferguson police chief admits that #MikeBrown was stopped for walking in the road.

#p2 http://t.co/6giGtKQgaB
Shoot unarmed kid.
Conceal evidence.
Impose martial law.
Harass reporters.
Smear the victim.
Worst. Police. Ever.
#Ferguson #MikeBrown
Bottom line: cops are supposed to use deadly force only when lives are at risk. You don't shoot robbery suspects. #Ferguson
I refuse to call the #Ferguson police chief incompetent when it is so clear the release of that video was calculated and brazen. #MikeBrown
#Ferguson Police apparently has a history of fabrication.  http://t.co/x1d3QTfEBx
Currently the #FoxNews website has zero, repeat, ZERO coverage of the #Ferguson protests, probably due to lack of cowboy hats.
Let's not forget that even if Mike Brown did shoplift, that's not why police said he was stopped or why he was shot. #mikebrown #ferguson
despite clear footage of #ferguson citizens chanting "killer cops have got to go", media chooses to hear &amp; report "kill the cops" instead.
Here's the police report. Somehow #Ferguson cops valued a box of Swishers at nearly $50. Time to stop smokin I guess http://t.co/8ZkvrHkApc
URGENT: Darren Wilson is the police officer who shot Mike Brown http://t.co/RZ1eYcKpiY #Ferguson http://t.co/D2HyKchWvq
RT @bonedog84: Over 50 people have been arrested in #Ferguson.

None of them is the cop who shot that boy 10 times in cold blood.
#Ferguson PD made #MikeBrown the suspect in that "robbery" police report. ON WHAT BASIS DID THEY NAME HIM? Unless it was written after....
.@AP I demand you retract the lie that people in #Ferguson were shouting "kill the police", local reporting has refuted your ugly racism
Police have thrown something at the crowd. Not sure what tho. Protester says "they have enough bullets for everybody down here #Ferguson
so if he was with #DorianJohnson at the robbery why wasn't he in custody? All media outlets interviewed him before the police #Ferguson
Boom RT @newsneighbor Why was #Ferguson PD still looking for the suspect 7 hours after Michael Brown had been killed? http://t.co/4TH5aFsge2
Name of #Ferguson cop is expected to be released by 9 ET, police chief says: http://t.co/NhMsTgfzYi (J.B. Forbes, AP) http://t.co/7LU1iT1EKB
Ferguson PD now admits that Darren Wilson didn't know anything about the store robbery when he stopped Mike Brown! This is bad! #Ferguson
the media didn't even know the video existed, but he just said they requested it? DUDE. #Ferguson
Darren Wilson is a six year veteran of the #Ferguson Police and had no disciplinary actions against him.
#Ferguson police: Officer involved in fatal shooting of Michael Brown didn't know he was suspect in alleged robbery. http://t.co/L6bieyrz2a
Possible "robbery" took place and BAM! Like magic it's as if another UNARMED black youth being murdered has been forgotten #smh #Ferguson
They released that information this morning about the robbery KNOWING #MikeBrown wasn't stopped for it? Explain why. EXPLAIN. WHY. #Ferguson
So the angel Michael Brown who is 6'4" 290 is the robber of the convenience store! #Ferguson http://t.co/d81cQPHzbi
#Ferguson police say Michael Brown fit description of strong-arm robbery suspect  http://t.co/bxXMNDzhe6
I'm so disgusted. #Ferguson RT @ZandarVTS: This has now devolved into the worst police shooting cover-up attempt in US history.
today #MichaelBrown would've completed his 1st week of college &amp; #Ferguson police chief spent most time suggesting he's the criminal
If Dorian Johnson is a suspect in a robbery that justified #DarrenWilson killing #MikeBrown, why hasn't Dorian been arrested? #Ferguson
Shot ten times.
Unarmed.
What else is there to talk about?
#StopTheSmear #Ferguson
So basically #Ferguson PD hijacked what was supposed to be a press conference about Darren Wilson to call Michael Brown a criminal #NMOS14
In case YouTube vid disappears, here's childhood friend on tonight's #Ferguson "drive by" #Bullshit #OpFerguson http://t.co/tkc6oIniUY
Police reports released this morning indicate Mike Brown was a suspect in a "strong-armed" robbery in #Ferguson
The press conf makes #Ferguson PD look like they've gone from stonewalling to counter punching. We give up a name, we drag his thru the mud.
The police chief is a 5 star general in projection, imagination and deflection...took a week to hatch this theory #Ferguson
"The officers were literally putting hands on media personnel, throwing people..." http://t.co/7QTY8soT46 #Ferguson
Hobby Lobby asks #Ferguson PD for clarification: "We thought chopping off someone's hand was the maximum penalty for shoplifting"
The ferguson chief says that his feelings are hurt that ppl consider him a part of the problem. #ferguson http://t.co/VoJGrMOPbZ
Took a week, but we finally at the moment where Mike Brown Is officially a suspect in his own murder. #Ferguson
#Ferguson police say Michael Brown was robbery suspect, which totally explains why he got the death penalty without a trial.
#Ferguson police say shooting death of Michael Brown came after teen was suspect in robbery: http://t.co/KSXV15Y5yw http://t.co/qi7Z5SUWtS

Is the Police Chief in #Ferguson changing the story?  https://t.co/8ujqp0lpb5
They wanted u 2 believe that #TrayvonMartin was a criminal, #EricGarner a criminal, #RenishaMcBride a thief, &amp; now #MikeBrown #Ferguson
#Ferguson police hand out info to make Michael Brown seem like a thug. But nothing on how he was actually killed, interaction with officer.
At 8:00 police will release the name of the officer who shot Michael Brown. #Ferguson
Chief seems to make it very clear that shooter did NOT write an incident report. 5th Amendment. #Ferguson
The officer who shot #MikeBrown did NOT know he was a suspect in a robbery, according to #Ferguson police chief. They were not related.
Another account of what happened to #MikeBrown #JusticeForMikeBrown http://t.co/sOD2olFYwp #STL #FERGUSON
MSNBC is literally reporting that Police Chief CLEARLY said it was about jay walking. 

This is a fucking clown show. #Ferguson
#Ferguson Chief confirmed name of officer who shot #MichaelBrown is Darren Wilson. @ksdknews
I'm not retweeting the pic of #MikeBrown's body, but evidently he lost the hat and changed his shoes and shorts. And lost ~40 lbs. #Ferguson
If #MikeBrown is indeed the robber, where’s the red ball cap? Sandals? Stolen cigars? #ferguson
#Ferguson officials to release name of cop who shot Michael Brown on Friday http://t.co/x0P9yUhzUU http://t.co/Gk2DxncNov
#Breaking: The officer involved in the shooting of Michael Brown is named Darren Wilson, #Ferguson police chief says.
Cops were extra aggressive to incite fear and cause chaos, giving the #Ferguson PD time to destroy and/or manufacture any "evidence" needed
Lawyers for police in bad shootings often advise shooters not to write reports or even speak to commanders or investigators. #Ferguson

Everybody was orgasming about a white cop killing an "innocent" black kid. Reality kicked them in the nuts. #Ferguson http://t.co/hUx29W6P10
#ferguson police engaged in character assassination to cover up actual assassination. you. simply. don't. shoot. unarmed. teenagers. EVER.
First, #MikeBrown was accused of shoplifting. Now, it's a robbery? It's very telling how the #Ferguson PD keeps spewing lie after lie.
Did anyone think of comparing the clothes that #MikeBrown was wearing when he was laying on the street to the security footage? #Ferguson
"I know his initial contact was not related to the robbery," #Ferguson chief says. "It was related to blocking the road."
The #Ferguson police chief just basically confirmed #MikeBrown was gunned to death for the crime of walking in the street?

Horrific.
*IF* the report was written same day as the shooting, as bungling as #Ferguson cops have been, we're to believe they had #MikeBrown's name?
So in #Ferguson, robbing a convenience carries the death penalty. Got it.
Wait wasn't Michael Brown stopped because of a routine patrol? Police can't even keep their stories straight. #Ferguson @OpFerguson

How many white celebrities have been CAUGHT shoplifting and end up dead in streets? I'll wait. #Ferguson
Police chief said officer who shot Brown didn't know about any robbery #ferguson
I personally don't trust St. Louis County PD, and I think they waited all this time to forge and falsify evidence. #Ferguson #MikeBrown

Let's be serious, it took 5 days to release the incident report because it took 5 days to create the incident. #Ferguson
Before his death #MikeBrown told his mother, "The world will know who #MichaelBrown is!" #Ferguson
#Ferguson PD releases robbery incident report smearing #MikeBrown but not shooting incident report. Did they think we wouldn’t notice?
BREAKING: Darren Wilson named as officer who fatally shot #MichaelBrown in #Ferguson
WOW RT @themarkberman: "The initial contact between the officer and Mr. Brown was not related to the robbery," #Ferguson police chief says
This #Ferguson PD chief press conference is AMAZING... he just ADMITTED Darren Wilson stopped him bc of the jaywalking.
Arrived in Crestwood where officer Darren Wilson lives. When I knocked police officer rolled up and told me Wilson left days ago #Ferguson
BOMBSHELL: #Ferguson chief says the police officer might not have even known about the robbery when he shot and killed Michael Brown.

#Ferguson police chief just confirmed that officer's interaction with Michael Brown NOT related to the robbery.
If you can justify shooting an unarmed teenager by saying "he might have been committing a misdemeanor" you are a fucking asshole. #Ferguson
They desecrated #mikebrown's body then they desecrated his memory and plight for justice. 

EXPLAIN THIS. 

#Ferguson #DONTSHOOT
Just did a google map search. There are 2 Quick Trips in #Ferguson and they are on opposite ends of the town. Did #MikeBrown teleport?
That was very "SLICK" of the Police Chief to create a narrative that #MikeBrown was a "suspect" in a robbery!  #Ferguson
Exactly. Why release the video if stopping Mike Brown was not related to the robbery? JESUS CHRIST THIS IS BAD. #Ferguson

Q: "why did he stop Michael Brown?" 

#Ferguson Police Chief: "because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic"
Let's be clear, #Ferguson PD never said Officer Darren Wilson was responding to robbery call before contact w/ #MikeBrown until today.

It's not #MikeBrown in those #Ferguson police video stills. Not unless he changed his shoes after the robbery but before he met the officer.
The #Ferguson police chief confirmed the stop of #MikeBrown had absolutely nothing to do with the alleged convenience store robbery.
The other day I asked a manager at the #Ferguson Market if police had requested surveillance video. She said no.
Supposedly there might be one or two witnesses who have the shooting or part of the shooting recorded on their phones. #Ferguson
#Ferguson Police Chief says #MikeBrown was stopped because he was walking in road NOT because he was suspected of stealing cigars.

Intolerance cannot be an answer to Intolerance.Has to be unequivocal condemnation of the terror attack as well as attacks on Paris mosques
White House speaking notes:
1. #CharlieHebdo not about Islam
2. Killers mentally unstable
3. Terror has no religion
4. Muslims fear backlash

Telling that some are calling the Charlie Hebdo shootings “the worst terrorist attack in Europe since 2005.” Breivik doesn’t even register.
"Female Islamist terrorist" attacks Paris Jewish store. As a woman, she has equal rights only when it comes to murdering nonbelievers.
So far today the UK media, while reporting on #CharlieHebdo, has pixelated images of a cartoon but happily posted a video of a brutal murder

Anybody who wants to talk about what Charlie Hebdo might have done to "provoke" this should probably shut up, forever.
The attack on Charlie Hebdo is likely to radicalize all sides in the debate about Islam and Islamism. That's what terrorists are aiming for.
